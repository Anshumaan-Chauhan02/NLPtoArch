The FGS_System consists of L_FGS, R_FGS, LR_Bus, RL_Bus, CLK1, CLK2, CLK3 and CLK4. 
LR_Bus transfers Left_Pilot_Flying_Side from L_FGS to R_FGS. 
RL_Bus transfers Right_Pilot_Flying_Side from R_FGS to L_FGS. 
The L_FGS imports TS_Bool_L and PS_Bool_L. 
The R_FGS imports TS_Bool_L and PS_Bool_L. 
L_FGS receives temporal_value from CLK1. 
LR_Bus receives temporal_value from CLK2. 
R_FGS receives temporal_value from CLK3. 
RL_Bus receives temporal_value from CLK4.
