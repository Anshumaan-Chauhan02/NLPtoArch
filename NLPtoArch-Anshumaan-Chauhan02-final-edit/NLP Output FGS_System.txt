FGS_SYSTEM consists L_FGS , R_FGS , LR_BUS , RL_BUS , CLK1 , CLK2 , CLK3 and CLK4. 
LR_BUS transfers Left_Pilot_Flying_Side from L_FGS to R_FGS. 
RL_BUS transfers Right_Pilot_Flying_Side from R_FGS to L_FGS. 
L_FGS imports TS_Bool_L and PS_Bool_L. 
R_FGS imports TS_Bool_L and PS_Bool_L. 
L_FGS receives temporal_value from CLK1.
LR_BUS receives temporal_value from CLK2.
R_FGS receives temporal_value from CLK3.
RL_BUS receives temporal_value from CLK4.
